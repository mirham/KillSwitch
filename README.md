## Introduction
MirHam KillSwich is a MacOS menu bar application designed to provide additional control over your internet connection. It helps ensure your safety by disabling all physical network interfaces when your public IP address changes to an unsafe one. This allows you time to determine what happened to the connection and restore safe conditions before continuing your work. This application is especially useful for VPN users, particularly those using modern protocols such as VLESS, Trojan, SS, and more.

## Features
- Easy to use
- Adjustable and flexible
- Operates continuously, even after computer restarts
- Periodic IP checks at desired intervals
- Automatically or manually close applications
- Manage physical network connections

## Getting Started

### Compatibility

This application is compatible with macOS 14.0 and above.

### Installation

Download the DMG installer from the [releases](https://github.com/mirham/KillSwitch/releases), mount it, and drag and drop the application to the Applications folder. That's it! However, you will need to allow launching applications from unidentified developers to start the application, as I don't have an Apple developer license.

## Improvement
> [!TIP]
> If you have any ideas, thoughts, or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me. I'm happy to help and improve the application.

## Disclaimer
> [!WARNING]
> I'm not a professional Swift developer (though I am a professional .NET developer). All my macOS apps are made for personal use by myself and my family simply because I have the skills to create them (and for fun, of course ðŸ˜Š). If my application has caused any harm, I apologize for that, but please be aware that you use it at your own risk.
